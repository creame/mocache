# MOCache (WordPress .mo cached translations)

The WordPress gettext implementation is very slow. It uses objects that
cannot be cached into memory without reinstanting them.

MOCache generate a PHP hashtable (array) with all seen translations.
If external object cache (Redis, Memcache, Memcached, etc.) is active they are saved in transients.
If not, they are saved in temp files (OPcache can grab the values from memory).

Moreover, MOCache does lazyloading for strings that are only encountered in output.
It does not load all translations for a domain if it is not necessary.

## Installation

Drop `mo-cache.php` into `wp-content/mu-plugins` and enjoy the added speed :)

The more plugins you have the better the performance gains.
